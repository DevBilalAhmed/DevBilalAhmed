**`Developer`**

Note: This Github profile and readme is under construction, im using another github profile at the moment since it provides a student pack through my student mail. but im planning to make this my main profile. some repositories might be forked, or transferred ownership from: https://github.com/bilalStudy 

I'm Currently a third-year student at HÃ¸yskolen Kristiania, The coding projects built by me are usually focused on full-stack applications. Im hoping to learn more about the IT-world and create more projects as a junior developer.
